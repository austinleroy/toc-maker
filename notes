ucas is basically just concatenated uasset files with alignment
to compression block sizing

utoc is a header file that points to ucas - holds useful info on
file paths, directories, compression config, sizes, etc.

utoc always seems to have an extra compression block at the end...?
need to see why this is.  Adding blank data to the end of the ucas
file seems to work okay so that the app doesn't crash at least.


Do I need to worry about .pak file generation here?  Thinking it
might have an archive size attribute or something I need to set.
